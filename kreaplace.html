                <h1 class="title">Large screen version</h1>
                <h2 class="subtitle">As we found out during our research, many respondents prefered idea of large screen
                    varsion
                    as it is much easier navigable when doing activites such as knitting or crocheting. For many
                    enthusiasts it was
                    easier to imagine following tutorial on a computer screen. Thus, in the development process, we
                    decided to prioritize preference of our target audience
                    and coded a solution for large screens only. To finish prototype we created mockups for mobile
                    version as well to make the product responsive.
