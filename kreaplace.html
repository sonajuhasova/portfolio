                    create a platform where all knitting and crocheting enthusiasts would find inspiration and help when
                    needed.

            <h1 class="title module">Prototype</h1>
            <h2 class="head-subtitle module">As we found out during our research, many respondents prefered idea of
                large
                screen version as it is much easier navigable when doing activites such as knitting or crocheting. For
                many
                enthusiasts it was easier to imagine following tutorial on a computer screen. Thus, in the development
                process, we
                decided to prioritize preference of our target audience
                and coded a solution for large screens only. To finish prototype we created mockups for mobile
                version as well to make the product responsive.
