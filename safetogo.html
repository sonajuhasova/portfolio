                <h3 class="subtitle">SafeToGo is a project based on a real life experience where people with weaker
                    immunity were forced to avoid crowds and protect themselves against Covid19.
                    However, it is not possible to avoid interaction with other people on daily basis. In order to help
                    our target audience interact safely, we created a digital solution showing crowdedness status in
                    public spaces at exact moment as well as in general during opening hours.
