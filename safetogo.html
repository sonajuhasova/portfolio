                <h3 class="subtitle">SafeToGo is a project based on a real life experience where people with weaker
                    immunity were forced to avoid crowds and protect themselves against Covid19.
                    However, it is not possible to avoid interaction with other people on daily basis. In order to help
                    our target audience interact safely, we created a digital solution showing crowdedness status in
                    public spaces at exact moment as well as in general during opening hours.

                    informed
                    about
                    functionalities. After that users continue to home page where they can search for different
                    locations
                    on the map and display details about each.
                    <br>
                    After expanding details section users can see gradient bar reporting exact situation in current
                    place.
                    Below that graphs inform user about crowdedness status during opening hours.

                    In the bottom users are able to activate the notification and be informed when it is safe to go.
                    Users
                    are also able to save their favourite locations in the Favourites section.

                    colour coded elements according to the current situation in an exact place. When choosing colours
                    we opted for traditional way of displaying awareness by using red, safety with green and medium
                    status with yellow on the map markers as well as details showing container.

                <h2 class="subtitle wide-text">In this project we used two different APIs. For displaying map and
                    address of the place the app is fetching data from Mapbox API.
                    <br><br>
                    In order to display actual situation we used API from BestTime. The app is fetching live forecast
                    and using its value we were able to adjust colour coded system along with position of location icon
                    in the gradient bar, which inform users about current crowdedness status in exact destination.
                    <br><br>
                    Using crowdedness values during opening hours we implemented a graph displaying status of a place
                    throughout the day.</h2>
